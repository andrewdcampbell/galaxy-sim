A modified version of my final project for CS184: Computer Graphics at UC Berkeley in Spring 2019, developed by me and two other collaborators. See the original project report with more information and references [here](https://aparikh98.github.io/CosmologicalSimulation/), or the project video [here](https://youtu.be/ROuIVfnqMWk). Note that this app is largely based on [@magwo's fullofstars](https://github.com/magwo/fullofstars) repo.

This is a real-time N-body particle simulation for the browser in WebGL. This simulation depicts gas clouds coalescing into stars orbiting around a black hole in the center of a disk galaxy. There are controls to change the opacity of materials, adjust the gravitational strength, choose from various cubemap backgrounds, and control a camera to pan and zoom across the scene.

In addition to the controls panel, there are various key commands:

| Key  | Action | 
| --- | --- |
| `1` | Switch to free orbit camera (default) |
| `2` | Switch to guided camera |
| `r` | Toggle autorotation in orbit camera |
| `l` | Increase pixel display ratio (will appear sharper on high-resolution displays) |
| `SPACE` | Play/Pause simulation |
| `h` | Hide/show controls panel |
| `a` | ðŸ¤” |
